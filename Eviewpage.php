                        The Roman leader, Centurion is suited in full battle gear with suit, shield, battle axe 
                        and pistol. He charges forward to lead his Legionaries to a faceoff with the infamous 
                        Celtics Gauls. The Legionaries are suited in full Roman battle costuming consisting of 
                        red plumed head gear with neck protective armor and their weaponry includes a gladius, 
                        shield and pistol. The Celtic Gauls have long hair that is treated with a white paste

                        When the opposition strikes the red capsule insert with the gladius a deep red substance

                        Program referees will detect the gush of faux blood and declare the warrior dead.

                        The Host offers an explanation of the season’s format and rules of the competition. 
                        During the first three minutes of man-to-man combat the battle is limited to the use 
                        of the gladius. Therefore, simulating real battles as they occurred.  During the contest 
                        Soldiers and Gauls who battle among the smoldering ruins are limited to 30 seconds at any 
                        given position. This rule is to promote continuous movement during the contest. 

                        Program referees are positioned to quickly identify fallen Soldiers and Gauls.  
                        At the point when either the Roman Soldiers of Celtic Gauls encounter a loss of 15 of their
                        25 troops, they are declared the looser in the competition.  After a final count of fallen 
                        warriors is confirmed the winning team is announced. During a break, Romans and Celtics reunite. 
                        The winning troop’s leader stands above his troops and declares victory in the battle. 
                        They are seen drinking and boasting without regard to the demise of the fallen enemy.  

                        In only the finale, competition begins with the usual number of troops, however as Soldiers and 
                        Gauls are terminated Reserve Replacements may enter at the time of death. Reserves are limited 
                        to three individuals and prospects may be purged from contestants of battles already eliminated 
                        in previous episodes.   
                                            
                        <h3 class="view__header"> The Battle and Game Time Scenario</h3>

                        <h5>Episode 1- A Mission to Kill</h5> 

                        <h5>Troops compete in a real battle</h5>

                        At the commencement, a Roman Centurion stands over his troop of Legions and shouts his command 
                        to advance upon enemy Celtic Gauls. They are seen burning and destroying a Roman settlement and 
                        a battle-built chariot. The Legions chant and wield their gladius with approval. Both troops 
                        muscle-up and prepare for battle. 

                        In the opening moments the Soldiers and Gauls are seen charging toward each other and wielding 
                        their gladius. Contact is made and a great battle ensues. Within a few moments the troops exchange 
                        deadly stab wounds as witnessed by the sudden gush of blood flowing from their chest armor. 
                        Five Roman Soldiers and five Celtic Gauls have fallen. The slashing and probing of the gladius 
                        weaponry come to an abrupt halt as the distinct cracking sound of cannon fire is heard nearby. 

                        Fire and smoke permeate the scene as 10 Roman Soldiers and 10 Celtic Gauls scatter to find 
                        sheltered positions. As the smoke begins to settle the troops can be seen taking positions 
                        among the burning ruins. With the exception of the fallen troops that perished during the 
                        initial man-to-man combat, the remaining 10 from each troop remain on the front lines and 
                        continue to battle in a man-to-man combat. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Soldiers and Gauls are seen in a shoot-out at the site of the burning chariot. Others duel 
                        among the stone walls and towers. A partly destroyed stone wall is shelter to a trio of troops. 
                        In an open field, Soldiers and Gauls brave their exposure in a shoot-out.  

                        Back to the front lines, the 20 opposing troops continue to weild their gladius and attempt to 
                        pierce the rival’s chest armor blood capsule. Soldiers and Gauls are falling in this highly 
                        contested battle.  

                        Program referees are quick to identify fallen Soldiers and Gauls.  On the front lines 9 of the 
                        15 Roman Soldiers have perished and 11of the 15 Celtic Gauls have perished. Back to the battle 
                        at the ruins, a count of 3 Roman Soldiers have perished and 3 Celtic Gauls have perished. 

                        <p class="view__text--paragraph"> Score; 12 Dead Romans </p>
                        <p class="view__text--paragraph"> 14 Dead Celtics </p>             
                        <p>
                        Reminder: At the point when either the Roman Soldiers of Celtic Gauls encounter a total loss of 
                        15 troops they are declared the looser in the competition.
                        <p>

                        Battles continue with the Celtics just one death away from losing it all. Can the Romans hold on 
                        from seeing three of their soldiers perish before witnessing one more Celtic death.

                        The battle ends when the next Gaul receives a death blow to the chest. Blood gushes from the blood 
                        capsule and there is no question that the Celtic Gaul has been killed.
                        
                        After a final count of fallen warriors, it becomes clear that the Roman Soldiers have prevailed. 
                        During a break, Romans and Celtics reunite. The Roman Centurian stands above his troops and declares 
                        the Romans victory. Drinking and boasting of their triumph is so annoying to the defeated Celtics.  

                        Having prevailed, the Romans are confident in winning their next battle in Week 2.
